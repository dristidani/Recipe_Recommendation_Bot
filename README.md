# Recipe Recommendation Chatbot ðŸ¥˜ðŸ¥—ðŸ¤–

## Overview

The Recipe Recommendation Chatbot is designed to provide personalized cooking recipe recommendations. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain to manage interactions and Pinecone for vector storage. The chatbot can handle various user preferences, including dietary restrictions, cuisine types, available ingredients, and cooking time.

## Features

- **Personalized Recipe Recommendations**: Offers suggestions based on user inputs.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains context across conversations within the same session.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Processes and retrieves information from a pre-existing dataset of recipes stored in PDFs.
- **Out-of-Scope Query Handling**: Provides appropriate responses for queries outside the chatbot's scope.
- **Unavailable Data Management**: Informs users when requested data is not available.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-recommendation-chatbot.git
   cd recipe-recommendation-chatbot
   
2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

```bash
 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set Up Secrets**

Create a secrets.toml file in the .streamlit directory with the following content:

```toml
 
[openai]
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

[pinecone]
api_key = "your_pinecone_api_key"
environment = "your_pinecone_environment"
```

5. **Run the Application**

```bash
 
streamlit run recipechatbot.py
```

### Usage
#### Asking Questions

Start the chatbot and interact through the chat interface.
You can ask for recipe recommendations based on specific ingredients, dietary restrictions, or cuisine types.

#### Enhanced Query Handling
The Recipe Recommendation Chatbot is designed not only to provide standard recipe recommendations but also to handle more complex and nuanced queries that reflect real-life cooking scenarios. Below are examples of how the chatbot can manage such enhanced queries.

##### Example Enhanced Queries and Responses
1. **Multiple Preferences and Dietary Restrictions**
User Query: "I'm planning a dinner for friends who have various dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, vegetarian, and dairy-free. Can you suggest a three-course meal that accommodates all these needs?"
2. **Ingredient-Based Suggestions**
User Query: "I have chicken breast, broccoli, and quinoa at home. I want to prepare a healthy, low-calorie dinner that includes a flavorful sauce. What can I make?"
3. **Brunch Menu for Specific Diets**
User Query: "I'm hosting a brunch and want to serve a mix of sweet and savory dishes. One guest is vegan, and another prefers low-carb options. Can you recommend recipes that cater to both preferences?"


#### Handling Out-of-Scope Queries
The chatbot will inform users when a question is out of scope.

Example: "Why is the sky blue?"

I'm here to assist with cooking recipe recommendations. For inquiries about natural phenomena such as why the sky is blue, you might need to consult a science resource or ask a science expert. However, I'm here to help with any cooking or recipe questions you have!

#### Handling Unavailable Data
The chatbot will inform users if the requested information is not available.

Example: "Can you give me a recipe for a dish not in the database?"

I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for in my database. Can I help you with something else related to cooking recipes or ingredients?

- requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
- .streamlit/secrets.toml: Configuration file for API keys.


### Report

#### Approach Taken
The chatbot was developed using a combination of LangChain for managing interactions and Pinecone for vector storage. The primary goal was to create a RAG pipeline to provide accurate and context-aware recipe recommendations.

#### Challenges Faced

- Integration with Pinecone: Ensuring efficient indexing and retrieval of recipe data.
- Context Management: Maintaining conversation context across multiple user interactions.
- Handling Out-of-Scope Queries: Implementing a mechanism to detect and respond appropriately to out-of-scope queries.

#### Overcoming Challenges

- Efficient Data Chunking: Implemented an asynchronous method to load and chunk PDF data, improving response times.
- Enhanced Prompts: Used detailed and structured prompts to guide the language model in generating accurate and context-aware responses.
- Error Handling: Added checks for out-of-scope queries and unavailable data to enhance user experience.

#### Future Enhancements

- User Profiles: Implementing user profiles to store preferences and history for more personalized recommendations.
- Enhanced Data Features: Including more detailed recipe metadata, such as nutritional information, difficulty levels, and cooking times.
- Community Features: Allowing users to rate and review recipes, and submit their own recipes for aricher community-driven experience.
